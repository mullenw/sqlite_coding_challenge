For this coding assignment we were tasked with four different SQLite queries

Task 1 — Top 5 Customers by Total Spend
Jacob Foster and Ethan Gomez are the top spenders, together they contributed over $16,000 in lifetime spend. This represents a huge share of total customer value.
The top five customers show a steep drop-off after the first two, this suggests a highly concentrated spending distribution. Which means that a few customers drive most revenue.

Task 2 — Total Revenue by Product Category

Task 3 — Employees Earning Above Their Department Average

Task 4 — Cities with the Most Loyal Customers
