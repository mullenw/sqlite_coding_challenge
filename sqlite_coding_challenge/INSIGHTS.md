For this coding assignment we were tasked with four different SQLite queries

Task 1 — Top 5 Customers by Total Spend
Jacob Foster and Ethan Gomez are the top spenders, together they contributed over $16,000 in lifetime spend. This represents a huge share of total customer value.
The top five customers show a steep drop-off after the first two, this suggests a highly concentrated spending distribution. Which means that a few customers drive most revenue.

Task 2 — Total Revenue by Product Category
Electronics dominate revenue with a staggering $25,364. This is nearly double the next-highest category.
Furniture is the second-strongest category at $12,712, showing some demand but still far behind Electronics.
Grocery and Stationery generate insignificant revenue under $500 each. This shows that these categories play a very small role in overall sales.
The business is heavily dependent on two categories: Electronics and Furniture. This could lead to a category concentration risk, but also highlights opportunity for targeted marketing.

Task 3 — Employees Earning Above Their Department Average
High performers exist in every department. Each listed employee earns well above their department’s average salary.
IT has the biggest salary gap, with Maya Bennett earning $112,000 compared to a department average of $105,333. This shows that some technical roles pay higher than others on the team.
In Sales Alice Nguyen earns $72,000 vs. a $61,000 average. It seems like pay in this department is more consistent across the employees.

Task 4 — Cities with the Most Loyal Customers
