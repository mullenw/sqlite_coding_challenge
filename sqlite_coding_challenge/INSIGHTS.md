For this coding assignment we were tasked with four different SQLite queries

Task 1 — Top 5 Customers by Total Spend
Jacob Foster and Ethan Gomez are the top spenders, together they contributed over $16,000 in lifetime spend. This represents a huge share of total customer value.
The top five customers show a steep drop-off after the first two, this suggests a highly concentrated spending distribution. Which means that a few customers drive most revenue.

Task 2 — Total Revenue by Product Category
Electronics dominate revenue with a staggering $25,364. This is nearly double the next-highest category.
Furniture is the second-strongest category at $12,712, showing some demand but still far behind Electronics.
Grocery and Stationery generate insignificant revenue under $500 each. This shows that these categories play a very small role in overall sales.
The business is heavily dependent on two categories: Electronics and Furniture. This could lead to a category concentration risk, but also highlights opportunity for targeted marketing.
Task 3 — Employees Earning Above Their Department Average

Task 4 — Cities with the Most Loyal Customers
